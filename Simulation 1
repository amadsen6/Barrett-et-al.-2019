## Replicate methods from Barrett 2019 paper on adaptive vs maladaptive social learning with HIREC

## define variables
c = 0 ## cost of individual learning relative to b
b = 0 ## benefit of adaptive behavior
s = 0 ## proportion of innovations
u = 0 ## rate of environmental change
p = 0 ## frequency of social learners for first phenotype
p2 = 1-p ## frequency of social learners at second phenotype
w0 = 0 ## baseline fitness
Q = 0 ## proportion of behaviors copied from the previous generation 
t = 1 ## time step

## to calculate the fitness based on cost of innovation and whether that innovation was adaptive
if(b > c){
  W = w0 + sb - c
}

## transmission of phenotypes from one generation to the next
