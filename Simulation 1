## Replicate methods from Barrett 2019 paper on adaptive vs maladaptive social learning with HIREC

## define variables
timesteps = seq(1, 100) ## time step
c = 1 ## cost of individual learning relative to b
b = 3 ## benefit of adaptive behavior
s = 0.8 ## proportion of innovations
U = 0.5 ## rate of environmental change, starts out stable (0.5)
p = rep(0, length(timesteps)+1) ## frequency of social learners
##p2 = 1-p ## frequency of individual learners
w0 = 1 ## baseline fitness
WI = rep(0, length(timesteps)) ## fitness of individual learners at each time step
WS = rep(0, length(timesteps)) ## fitness of social learners at each time step 
Wpop = rep(0, length(timesteps)) ## fitness of population at each time step
u = rep(0, length(timesteps))
Q = rep(0, length(timesteps)+1) ## frequency of adaptive behavior
ph = (1-U*s*b/c)/(1-U) #frequency of social learners; ph (p hat) is the steady state of the frequency of adaptive behaviors

## initialize parameters
p[1] = ph
Q[1] = 0 ## Qh?
u[1] = 0

for(t in 1:length(timesteps)){
  WS[t] = w0 + b*Q[t]
  Q[t+1] = (1-u[t])*((1-p[t])*s + p[t]*Q[t])
  p[t+1] = p[t]*WS[t]/(p[t]*WS[t] + (1-p[t]*WI))
  u[t+1] <- rbinom(n=1,prob=U,size=1) #sample environment changing in next gen, if 0 all SL behav maladaptive
}

plot(y = p, x = c(1:101), ylim=c(-0.05,1.09) , "l", col= "pink" , ylab="frequency of social learners (p)" , cex.lab=1.4)


##############
#### stuff
## to calculate the fitness based on cost of innovation and whether that innovation was adaptive
if(b > c){
  WI = w0 + s*b - c
}

## transmission of phenotypes from one generation to the next
Q[t] = (1-u)*((1-p)*s + p*Q[t-1])

## fitness of social learners copied from previous generation
WS[t] = w0 + Q[t]*b

## genetic steady state?
WS = WI
Q[t] = Q[t-1]

## initialize with p = ph... set as condition inside loop?
if(p = ph){
  #do something
}

if(Qh = Q[t]){
  Qh = s-(c/b)
}

## social learners invade if???
if(p = 0){
  u < c/s*b
}
## individual learners invade if???
if(p = 1){
  sb > c
}

## After HIREC
Q = (1-p)*s
